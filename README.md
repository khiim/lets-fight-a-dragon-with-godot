# Let's Fight a Dragon with Godot

This project was made by Kristian Hiim for a presentation called "Let's Fight a Dragon with Godot". The code is available here for you to study and learn. If you have any questions about the code, or want to discuss game programming in general, feel free to contact me.

## License details

See [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt) for details.

## Importing the project in Godot

This project was developed with the Godot game engine. It was first made for version 4.3, but has been upgraded to version 4.4.1 before presenting at NDC Oslo 2025.
Go to [Download Godot 4.4.1](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.4.1-stable/), and download the standard version for your OS. Run Godot and import this project.

## Project structure

There are four main folders in this projects:
* `/assets` contains graphics and sound effects.
* `/resources` contains any reusable resources. This folder only contains two tilesets, that are used to draw tiles on tilemaps.
* `/scenes` contains all the scenes in the project.
* `/scripts` contains all scripts.

There are two main scenes. The default scene is the first level, located at `/scenes/levels/volcano/volcano.tscn`. The slides used in the presentation are found at `/scenes/slides/slides.tscn`.

## About my project to learn the Godot Game Engine in 2024
In 2024, I committed to learning the Godot game engine, aiming to make at least one game programming-related commit to GitHub every day. Somehow I managed to submit this presentation to the Hello Stavanger 2024 conference. At Hello Stavanger I met some people interested in game programming, and together we joined the Github Game Off 2024 game jam in November. We actually managed to make and submit a game: [Seclica](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2024/rate/3148784). The source code for that game is also available on Github if you want to check it out.

## External resources
Here are some sites providing free assets that you can use if you want to make a game:
